# Analyzing Blood Type by Race

Using the blood types generated by an Arvados Pipeline and ethnicities from the Harvard Personal Genome Project, I've created a Python Program that associates blood types with races/ethnicities.  
The arvadodirect folders contain the blood types directly from Arvaods without any modification. It is there as a backup.

## To run:

Clone this to a directory and navigate there first

### For 173 Genomes from Harvard PGP:

Run `python AnalyzeByBloodTypePGP.py` and it should analyze and print out the results

### For 433 Genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project:

Navigate to /433-1000Genomes and type `python AnalyzeByBloodType1000Genomes.py` and it'll run on the genomes in that folder
