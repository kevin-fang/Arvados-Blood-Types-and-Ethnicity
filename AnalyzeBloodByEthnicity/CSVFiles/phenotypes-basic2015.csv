Some of my four children's eyes (all blue or blue with hazel rings or flecks) have lightened through the years (oldest is only 12, youngest not yet four).  My younger sister's blue eyes lightened a lot more than mine, and I've noticed the two of my children with hazel elements in their blue eyes have had their blue lighten up more than the other two.  My nearly-four-year-old daughter has dark blue eyes and looks almost identical to what I did at that age (not just eyes, but overall).  I doubt hers will lighten much; they haven't yet.

My paternal side of family are all blue-eyed, but again, there's a mix of tone.  I think everyone started out with dark or medium blue, and while some reached adulthood with medium to dark blue, others' eyes lightened, to end up with light-medium (no really light/pale blues in our family).  In general, but there may be exceptions, I've observed through the years that the dark-haired (med to dark brown) ones of us have kept a darker spectrum of blue in our eyes, while the lighter-haired (light brown to blonde) members tend to be the ones whose eyes have lightened more.

I have high-degree myopia (-9.50 and -10.00 glasses prescription; -8.00 and -8.50 in contacts).  Some members of my family also have myopia but not nearly as bad as mine.  My sister is the closest, and her contacts prescription is around -3.25.

Three of my four children have followed the same pattern: dark brown when born, a lighter color during toddler years (in their case, various shades of blonde), then darkening again.  Last child has maintained dark-medium brown hair since birth to current age of nearly four.","My maternal grandmother was a native of England, Irish descent.
